## Description ##
iLua is a Lua scripting framework for Windows that comes with a powerful visual editor/debugger and plenty of modules to make scripting simple tasks a breeze. Unlike traditional Lua, it supports preemptive multithreading, which allows for a much broader field of applications.

I'm actively working on improving the core module and adding additional modules. Feedback on module functionality and API is always welcome.
